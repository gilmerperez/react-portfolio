# React Portfolio

## Project Overview

The React Portfolio project is designed to showcase a web developer's skills and projects using React. The portfolio is a single-page application (SPA) built with React, featuring multiple sections like "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume." The portfolio aims to serve as a tool for job seekers to present their work to potential employers, as well as a platform to highlight their proficiency in React and web development skills.

This project implements key React concepts such as components, routing with `react-router-dom`, and conditional rendering. It also utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and styling. The portfolio is deployed on Netlify for easy access and sharing.
